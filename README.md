# GitDemo-Branching

## What to do with this file
1. Create a fork of this repository, clone it and load it into IntelliJ.
2. Start SourceTree (or equivalent) and load the folder in there as well. (Yes, you now have TWO tools look at the same repo.)
3. Before you do anything, answer these questions:
  * How many branches are there in the repository?
  * How many commits are there in each branch?

4. Experiment with swapping branches by clicking on the respective branches in SourceTree.
  * There is ONE commit that is a bit "dodgy" (as in: does more than just work on the feature..). Can you find out which one?
5. Study the changes made in the master branch after the branches were created.
6. With the knowledge you gained from 5., try merging the "weapons" branch into the "master" branch using either IntelliJ or SourceTree (SourceTree = recommended).
  * Note that there is a merge conflict to resolve. 
  * Note that at the moment you opt to merge the branch, you *immediately* need to resolve any issues.
7. Alternatively, you can create a "pull request" to merge later / in groups / etc.
  * Create a pull request now. Assign one of your fellow students as a reviewer.
